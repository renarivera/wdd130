        <p>Hi there, I'm Renato Rivera and I'm pursuing a bachelor's degree in Professional Studies at BYU Idaho. In the future, I would like to change my career to freelance and travel the world. I fully believe that if we are in this world, it is to discover it. I love programming and consider web development and design to be one of the most in-demand fields to work in remotely.

            <br>In my free time, I like to play the violin or take pictures of sunsets, animals, etc. I enjoy reading a lot, my favorite author is Isabell Allende, she is from Chile, I am currently reading 'Beyond Winter' or 'Más Allá del Invierno'.
            <br>
            <br> Currently, I am a Data Analyst in Ecuador, next month I will finish my degree as an Economist at a University in my Country Ecuador. For the next few months, I am preparing myself to grow in the company I work for, to move up to a Data Scientist position.
            <br>
            <br> I have been member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints for 16 years, my favorite quote is “If a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience … , he will have so much the advantage in the world to come” (D&C 130:19). I remember this quote before to start the day, each day.</p>

        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Montaje_Quito.png/405px-Montaje_Quito.png" alt="Quito historic center">
        <p>Quito's historic center is among the largest and best-preserved in the Americas. In 1978, Quito and Kraków were the first World Cultural Heritage Sites declared by UNESCO. Quito is the capital city closest to the Equator, with its northern limits ending about 1 km (0.62 miles) south of the line.</p>
